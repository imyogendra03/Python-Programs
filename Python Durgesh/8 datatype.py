# Data typw represent a type of value hold by variable.
#Python does not allow is to explicitly declare data type while creating variables it does autometic for us


a=45
# here a is int type data it auto decleared by interpretor

b=4.5
# here b is float type data.


#   ********************* NUMERIC DATA TYPE*****************************


x=67
c=3.4


# complex number in python we can write as 
# here replace i to j in python

c1=4+5j

c2=3+6j

print("sum of cmp.. is " ,(c1+c2))



#         now check the real and imagenry no in complex no. using obj.real  & obj.imag


c1.real
c1.imag



# we can take length of any int or float is infinite as

a=783267832467867478234823
b=7327489327589342793724923789547239847238947
# now we want to print the sum of a and b

print("sum of a&b is =",(a+b))




#        ********************String datatype in python*************************

# When we store anything under the single, double or triple quots ('fdsf',"fdgb","'jhsdfh"',)

#eg here s is a string

s="string"
b='''sdhfjkdshfklsdf'''
a='dfdsgdfgjksdhufgk'

# String are immutable in python
# means 

x="python"
x="interpretor"
# here the value of x is "interpretor" i.e called immutable string
